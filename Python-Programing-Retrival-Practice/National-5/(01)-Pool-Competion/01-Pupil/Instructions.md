# Pool Competition

Adam regularly challenges one of his teachers to a pool competition.  

The winner of their matches is the person who wins the most individual games of pool.

Adam wishes to write a computer program to calculate the total number of times each player wins a game and display a message congratulating the winner of the overall match.  

> Question 1

Adam wants the program to:

* Repeatedly ask the user to input the winner of each game

* Stop asking for input when the character “X” is entered

* Add up the number of wins for each player as the winner of each game is inputted

* Display a message congratulating the player who won the most games or display a message saying that the match was tied. 

**Write a program that meets Adam’s requirements.  (6)**
